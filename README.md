# Core Logs for Fivemanage

Just some logs for fivemanage, for player joining, leaving and shooting (except for a jerrycan).

# Installation

Install the resource to your resource folder on the server, then generate a API key on the Fivemanage site. Put the key in config.lua and then make sure to start the resource in your server.cfg
